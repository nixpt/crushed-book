# Getting Started

Welcome to the Exosphere. This guide will take you from a curious observer to a proficient developer of **Capsules**.

## 🧭 The Onboarding Path

To get the most out of Exosphere, we recommend following these steps in order:

1.  **[Installation](installation.md)**: Set up the Exosphere toolchain on your local machine.
2.  **[Hello World Capsule](hello_world.md)**: Build and run a simple polyglot capsule.
3.  **[CLI Toolchain](cli_usage.md)**: Master the `crush` developer CLI and `packman`.
4.  **[Core Contract](exo_core.md)**: Understand the philosophy of mechanism vs. meaning.

## 🏗️ The Multi-Repo Ecosystem

Exosphere is split into several specialized repositories. As a developer, you will primarily interact with:

-   **`crush`**: The core runtime and VM.
-   **`crush-capsules`**: The library of guest runtimes and system tools.
-   **`crush-sdk`**: The tools for building your own capsules.
-   **`crushed-book`**: (You are here) The unified manual and specifications.

## 🎠 Your First Goal
By the end of this "Getting Started" section, you will have a running **Vortex** instance, successfully orchestrating a custom-built capsule on your host machine.
