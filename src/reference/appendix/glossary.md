# Glossary

### Arena
A centralized memory pool managed by the Crush VM. All complex objects (Strings, Arrays, Maps) reside in the Arena to ensure safety and isolation.

### CASM (Crush Assembly)
The low-level, target-independent instruction set executed by the Crush VM. 

### CAST (Crush AST)
The intermediate JSON representation of a program's semantic intent, generated by language walkers.

### Capsule
The primary unit of isolation and distribution in Crush. A capsule contains a manifest (`Capsule.toml`) and optionally a payload (CASM or native code).

### Capability
A specific, fine-grained permission granted to a capsule (e.g., `fs.read`). Capabilities are the only way capsules can interact with the host or each other.

### Exo-Core
The minimal virtualization layer of the Crush vOS. It manages the HAL, VFS, and capsule loading.

### HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
The interface between the vOS and the physical host hardware.

### Native Capsule
A capsule that is linked directly into the `crush` binary for performance or bootstrapping reasons (e.g., `core.fs`).

### Walker
A compiler component that translates source code from a specific language into CAST.

### Vortex
The interactive shell and REPL for the Crush environment.
